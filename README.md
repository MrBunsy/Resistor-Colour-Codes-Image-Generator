I found myself debating what labelling system to use on a cabinet of resistors I was filling.  I can never remember the resistor colour codes, and might have to double up more than one value in each drawer - so I thought a little diagram of which resistor is which on the front of every drawer would help!

I couldn't find anything out there that I could pinch, so I knocked this up quickly.
